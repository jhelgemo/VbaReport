# VbaReport
A simple VBA script made to automate an internal report

This simple script will check if spesific values have changed within a specified range of data since the last time the script ran. 
if any changes has occured, some of the data from these lines will be added to a report sheet based on a set template. The script will also run a HTTP request to check the online availability for these lines.
Once finished the script will send the completed report as an email attachment
